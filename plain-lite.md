# PLAIN LITE

This file is intended to become a lightweight version of the full plain.md specification — a more minimal, faster-to-complete version for early-stage ideas, solo makers, or rapid prototyping contexts.

It is not finalized yet and currently serves as a placeholder.

If you’re interested in shaping what this simplified version of PLAIN should look like, this is a great place to start contributing. Make sure to read the [Contribution Guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md) before opening a pull request.
