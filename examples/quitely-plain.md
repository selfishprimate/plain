# INITIAL PROMPT FOR AI AGENTS

You are an expert UI/UX designer and full-stack developer. I'm providing you with a PLAIN (Product Language for AI Notation) document that contains comprehensive project specifications. Read each section carefully and build the application exactly as specified. Pay special attention to Design Language, Color Palette, Typography, and Frontend Technology sections. Fill any gaps with appropriate defaults that match the overall design direction. Start by setting up the project structure and installing dependencies.

# Project Overview

The project name is "Quitely", which is described as a calmness and mindfulness app designed for people experiencing stress, anxiety, and overwhelm in their daily lives. The core purpose of the project is to help users reduce stress, find calmness, and improve mental well-being through accessible mindfulness practices.


# Design Language

The design style for Quitely is minimalist, with a focus on creating an accessible, clean, calm, and creative experience. The design references key inspiration from the following sources:

- https://www.calm.com - Soothing color palette, gentle animations, and calming visual hierarchy. Focus on spacious layouts that don't overwhelm the user.
- https://www.headspace.com - Playful yet calming illustrations, friendly onboarding flow, and approachable interface design. Warm colors combined with minimalist layout.

Additional notes emphasize the need to create a serene and non-intrusive experience, avoiding overstimulation through excessive colors, animations, or busy layouts. The design should promote mindfulness and tranquility, using gradual transitions and soft micro-interactions. Accessibility for users with anxiety or sensory sensitivities is also a consideration.

# Color Palette

The primary colors for Quitely are a Soft Blue (#6B9BD1) and Sage Green (#9CBAA5), which are calming colors that evoke serenity and nature. The secondary accent colors are Lavender (#B8A8D8) and Peach (#F4BFA6), which are soft and warm. The application supports both light and dark mode themes.


# Typography

The display font is Inter, the body font is Poppins, and the monospace font is Fira Code. The typescale follows a major second modular scale.


# Icons

The icon library used is Lucide, with an outlined icon style.


# Layout

The responsive strategy for Quitely is mobile-first. The layouts feature simple, card-based designs with generous spacing. A bottom navigation bar is used for primary actions. On mobile, single-column layouts are emphasized to reduce cognitive load, with a focus on vertical scrolling over horizontal navigation. Large, touch-friendly targets (minimum 44x44 pixels) and smooth, gentle transitions between screens are also key considerations.

# User Stories

As a stressed professional, I want to access quick breathing exercises during my work breaks, so that I can reduce anxiety and regain focus without leaving my desk.

As a new meditator, I want guided meditation sessions with varying lengths, so that I can practice mindfulness regardless of how much time I have available.

As someone with insomnia, I want to listen to calming ambient sounds and sleep stories, so that I can fall asleep more easily at night.

As a user tracking my progress, I want to see my meditation history and streaks, so that I can stay motivated and build a consistent mindfulness practice.

As someone experiencing anxiety, I want reminders throughout the day to pause and breathe, so that I can maintain calmness and mindfulness throughout my busy schedule.
