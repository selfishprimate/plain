# INITIAL PROMPT FOR AI AGENTS

You are an expert UI/UX designer and full-stack developer. I'm providing you with a PLAIN (Product Language for AI Notation) document that contains comprehensive project specifications. Read each section carefully and build the application exactly as specified. Pay special attention to Design Language, Color Palette, Typography, and Frontend Technology sections. Fill any gaps with appropriate defaults that match the overall design direction. Start by setting up the project structure and installing dependencies.

# Project Overview

**Project Name:** Culinara

**Idea Statement:** Culinara is a smart recipe discovery app for home cooks who want to reduce food waste and cook with ingredients they already have. It transforms your pantry into a personalized recipe generator, helping users make delicious meals from what's available without unnecessary shopping.

**Core Purpose:** The app solves the "what should I cook?" problem by analyzing available ingredients and suggesting creative, feasible recipes in real-time. This reduces decision fatigue, minimizes food waste, and encourages users to cook more meals at home using what they already own.

---

# Design Language

**Design Style:** Modern, warm, and approachable with subtle playfulness. The design should feel friendly and encouraging rather than clinical or corporate. Think contemporary recipe apps with a focus on warmth and human connection to cooking.

**Design Tone:** 
- Inspiring and creative (encouraging users to explore new recipes they haven't considered)
- Practical and helpful (grounded in real-world cooking constraints)
- Warm and inviting (celebrating the joy of cooking with what you have)

**Design References:**
- headspace.com (warm, human-centered design with illustrated elements and empathetic visual language)
- notion.so (clean, modern interface with playful iconography and excellent information hierarchy)

---

# Color Palette

**Primary Color:** #FF6B35 (Warm orange)
- Reasoning: Conveys warmth, appetite appeal, and energy. Reflects food and home cooking while maintaining modern vibrancy. Works well for CTAs and key interactions.

**Secondary Color:** #004E89 (Deep ocean blue)
- Reasoning: Provides contrast and grounds the interface. Suggests trust, quality ingredients, and culinary expertise. Excellent for secondary buttons and accents.

**Accent Color:** #7CB342 (Fresh green)
- Reasoning: Represents fresh ingredients, vegetables, and natural/organic farming. Used sparingly for ingredient highlights and success states.

**Neutral Base:** #F5F5F5 (Off-white) and #2C3E50 (Deep charcoal)
- For backgrounds and text respectively

**Dark Mode Support:** Yes - inverted palette with #1A1A1A background, #FF6B35 primary remains consistent, neutrals shift to lighter grays.

---

# Typography

**Display Font:** Inter Bold (weights 600-700)
- Reasoning: Modern, friendly, highly legible at all sizes. Excellent for headlines and app branding. Paired well with contemporary design sensibilities.

**Body Font:** Inter Regular (weights 400-500)
- Reasoning: Same family for cohesion, excellent readability at smaller sizes, optimal for recipe instructions and ingredient lists.

**Typescale:** 1.25 Major Third
- Base size: 16px
- Heading 1 (48px): Page titles, recipe names
- Heading 2 (36px): Section headers
- Heading 3 (24px): Subsections, card titles
- Body text (16px): Primary content
- Small text (12.8px): Metadata, timing info
- Tiny text (10.24px): Helper text, labels

---

# Icons

**Icon Library:** Lucide Icons (lucide.dev)
- Reasoning: Clean, modern, consistent stroke-weight design that matches the friendly aesthetic. Excellent ingredient-related icons (leaf, flame, clock, users, etc.).

**Icon Style:** Outlined (1.5px stroke weight)
- Consistent with contemporary design trends shown in reference images
- Maintains clarity at all sizes (16px to 48px)
- Custom ingredient icons: apple, carrot, chicken, fish, egg, tomato, cheese (custom SVG overlays on base Lucide set)

---

# Layout

**Responsive Strategy:** Mobile-first with fluid scaling
- Primary breakpoints: 320px (small mobile), 640px (mobile), 1024px (tablet), 1280px (desktop)
- Single-column layout on mobile transitioning to two-column on tablet
- Recipe cards stack vertically on mobile, grid layout (2-3 columns) on desktop
- Touch targets minimum 44px on mobile

**Key Considerations:**
- Ingredient input should be dead simple on mobile (large touch buttons, voice input option)
- Recipe detail pages should prioritize vertical scrolling on mobile (ingredients, then instructions, then reviews)
- Search/filter should remain sticky or easily accessible via bottom navigation on mobile
- Pantry management interface needs clear visual hierarchy with drag-and-drop on desktop, swipe on mobile

---

# Inspirations

- **Headspace** (headspace.com): Warm, illustrated visual style with human-centered design. Empathetic language and accessible, encouraging tone. Reference for onboarding and empty states.

- **Notion** (notion.so): Excellent information architecture, playful iconography, customizable workspaces. Reference for ingredient management dashboard and flexible UI patterns.

# Additional Notes

**Constraints & Considerations:**

- **Barcode Accuracy**: Barcode scanning works best for packaged items; loose produce detection may require manual input or image recognition (future enhancement).

- **Recipe Database Seeding**: Initial recipe database should include 500-1000 recipes across 10+ cuisines, sourced from open APIs or licensed recipe databases. Plan for ongoing curation.

- **Ingredient Standardization**: Handle measurement unit conversions (cups to grams, tbsp to ml) across regions. Store metric equivalents in database.

- **Cold Start Problem**: New users with empty pantries need compelling onboarding experience with suggested pantry staples and quick-wins. Show 50 "easy" recipes that use common items.

- **Offline Capability**: Cache favorite recipes and pantry locally using IndexedDB. Allow browsing and cooking offline with full instructions; sync when connection restores.

- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance required. Voice input critical for accessibility; screen reader testing on recipe instructions. High contrast mode for dark theme.

- **Performance**: Target Lighthouse scores of 90+. Optimize recipe images (responsive, WebP). Lazy-load recipe details. Infinite scroll on search results with pagination.

**Future Considerations:**

- **AI-Powered Seasonal Suggestions**: Use location data and seasonal ingredient availability to suggest timely recipes and alert users about peak-season produce.

- **Nutritional Goal Tracking**: Integration with fitness apps (Apple Health, Google Fit) to recommend recipes matching daily macro targets.

- **Subscription Tiers**: Free tier (basic recipe access), Premium tier (ad-free, advanced meal planning, nutrition tracking), Family Plan (shared pantry and meal planning).

- **Smart Grocery Integration**: API partnerships with major grocers to check real-time prices, handle unit size variations (bulk vs. single), and enable one-click ordering.

- **AR Recipe Visualization**: Augmented reality overlay showing plated dish or ingredient prep techniques using device camera.

- **Community Ratings & Variations**: User-submitted recipe modifications, crowdsourced tips, difficulty adjustments, and ingredient substitutions per cuisine region.

**Design Consistency Notes:**

Follow Headspace's warm, human-centered approach for onboarding and empty states. Use illustrated characters and encouraging language. Adopt Notion's playful iconography and clear information hierarchy for the pantry dashboard. Maintain the warm orange (#FF6B35) consistently across CTAs and highlights to reinforce brand identity. Ensure all interactive elements (buttons, cards, inputs) feel tactile and responsive with smooth micro-interactions (spring animations on saves, satisfying checkmark animations).
