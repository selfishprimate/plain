PLAIN (Product Language for AI Notation) is a markdown-based specification format that transforms product ideas into AI-ready documentation. It provides 16 structured sections covering design language, requirements, architecture, and implementation details - bridging the gap between product teams and AI development tools like v0, Bolt, and Lovable.
