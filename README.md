# PLAIN: Product Language for AI Notation

**PLAIN** is a structured documentation framework designed to help you define digital products in a format that's both human-friendly and machine-readable. It bridges the gap between product managers, designers, and AI-powered tools such as [v0](https://v0.dev), [Figma AI](https://www.figma.com/blog/design-ai), [Make](https://www.make.com), and [Lovable](https://www.lovable.so/).

With PLAIN, product ideas become structured assets â€” ready to be translated into user interfaces, code, and documentation by generative AI.

## ðŸ’¡ Inspirations

PLAIN takes inspiration from:
- Agile user stories
- PRD best practices
- AI prompt engineering
- Design tokens & atomic design thinking
