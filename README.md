# PLAIN: Product Language for AI Notation

**PLAIN** is a structured documentation framework designed to help you define digital products in a format that's both human-friendly and machine-readable. It bridges the gap between product managers, designers, and AI-powered tools such as [v0](https://v0.dev), [Figma AI](https://www.figma.com/blog/design-ai), [Make](https://www.make.com), and [Lovable](https://www.lovable.so/).

With PLAIN, product ideas become structured assets â€” ready to be translated into user interfaces, code, and documentation by generative AI.

## âœ¨ Key Features

- âœ… **Standardized templates**: Includes full and lightweight versions for different project needs
- ðŸ¤– **AI prompt compatibility**: Optimized for use with AI UI and code generation tools
- ðŸ§© **Modular design**: Easy to adopt partially or fully depending on your workflow
- ðŸ“š **Reference materials**: Real-world examples, prompt libraries, glossaries
- ðŸ”„ **Machine-readable output**: Markdown and JSON templates ensure easy integration

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure

- `plain-template.*`: PLAIN templates in Markdown and JSON formats
- `/examples/`: Real-life example documents based on real or conceptual products
- `/prompts/`: Modular prompt libraries for each section, including persona generation
- `/docs/`: Glossary, contribution guide, and related documentation

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Copy `plain-template.md` into your project
2. Fill out each section based on your idea, product, or feature
3. Use `/prompts/per-section-prompts.md` to auto-generate parts using AI tools
4. Use `.json` format if you plan to pipe into developer pipelines

You can also explore the `/examples` folder to see how PLAIN was used in real-world scenarios.

## ðŸ§  Why PLAIN?
Writing product documents is often a creative and messy process â€” especially when AI tools are involved. Traditional PRDs (Product Requirement Documents) were not built with generative systems in mind. PLAIN introduces a common language between humans and AI systems by using predictable, explicit structures, making it easier to:
- Collaborate with your team and LLMs at the same time
- Rapidly generate UI, content, or code with AI assistance
- Minimize misinterpretation and hallucination in LLM output

## ðŸ’¡ Inspirations

PLAIN takes inspiration from:
- Agile user stories
- PRD best practices
- AI prompt engineering
- Design tokens & atomic design thinking
