# PLAIN: Product Language for AI Notation

**PLAIN** is a structured documentation framework designed to help you define digital products in a format that's both human-friendly and machine-readable. It bridges the gap between product managers, designers, and AI-powered tools such as [v0](https://v0.dev), [Figma AI](https://www.figma.com/blog/design-ai), [Make](https://www.make.com), and [Lovable](https://www.lovable.so/).

With PLAIN, product ideas become structured assets ‚Äî ready to be translated into user interfaces, code, and documentation by generative AI.

## What is PLAIN? ü§î

PLAIN is more than just a static spec ‚Äî it‚Äôs a bridge between creative thinking and technical execution, formatted in a way that AI systems can parse, and product teams can understand.

- Clearly defines product vision and value in the ‚ÄúIdea Statement,‚Äù giving a concise foundation for all subsequent work.
- Breaks down visual and UX direction through dedicated sections on Design Language, Typography, Color, and more, enabling design consistency and AI interpretability.
- Details functional and non-functional requirements in structured, human-readable sections that guide both implementation and testing.
- Specifies technical implementation patterns such as state management, API design, and rendering methods, helping align developers and tools from day one.
- Creates a single source of truth that can be used to guide AI-generated UI code, component libraries, and workflows.

## Who is it for?

- AI tools that turn natural language into interfaces or code. PLAIN gives them the structure and semantics they need to generate relevant, high-quality output.
- Designers who need to translate product requirements into scalable systems, tokens, and layouts ‚Äî while collaborating with both AI and humans.
- Developers who want clarity and consistency in technical handoffs, including routing, architecture patterns, and data flow structures.
- Product managers and teams who want to replace messy Google Docs and scattered tools with a clean, AI-first way of describing what to build and why.

## How to Use
- Start with the template ‚Äî Make a copy of plain.md for your own product or idea.
- Follow the explanations ‚Äî Use plain-explained.md as your guide. Each section includes a detailed description and sample outputs to help you fill it with meaningful content.
- Use prompt helpers ‚Äî Explore the prompts/ folder to see how natural language inputs can drive AI tools to generate accurate section content.
- Reference existing examples ‚Äî Check the examples/ folder to see how other PLAIN documents are structured. These can be helpful when starting out.
- Feed your document to AI tools ‚Äî Once filled out, your PLAIN file becomes a prompt-ready artifact for tools like v0.dev, Figma Make, or your own model.

## Inspirations

PLAIN takes inspiration from:
- Agile user stories
- PRD best practices
- AI prompt engineering
- Design tokens & atomic design thinking
