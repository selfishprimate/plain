# Product Language for AI Notation Explained

This document represents a structured, AI-readable product definition format known as PLAIN (Product Language for AI Notation).
It is designed to be both human-friendly and machine-parseable. Each section of this document provides key information that enables AI tools to generate user interfaces, code, or product artifacts with minimal ambiguity.

Use this as the single source of truth to describe your product idea â€” and let both teams and AI agents build from it.

## 1. Idea Statement
The Idea Statement introduces the product concept in a way that clearly communicates its purpose, target audience, problems it solves, and core benefits. It should be written in 2â€“3 short paragraphs and focus on clarity, relevance, and specificity. The goal is not to impress with buzzwords, but to inform and orient the reader (or the AI) by answering key questions:

- Who is the product for?
- What does it enable them to do?
- What problems does it solve?
- How does it solve them?
- Why is it better/different from alternatives?

It is important to include both the functional and experiential aspects of the product. Do not generalizeâ€”describe key features, workflows, or value drivers that make the idea meaningful.

#### Examples

_The following examples illustrate the expected format and level of detail for an Idea Statement. Each should be written in 2â€“3 concise paragraphs, clearly describing the productâ€™s purpose, target users, key problems it solves, and how it delivers value._

## 2. Design Language
Outline the productâ€™s visual and interaction style. Cover visual identity, interaction principles, and structural guidelines to ensure consistency across design and code.

### Design Principles
Define the foundational design values that shape the UI: e.g., simplicity, speed, or playfulness, guiding all stylistic decisions.

#### Commands
```
List 3 design principles for the {project_name}, focusing on clarity and efficiency.
```
```
Define key interface valuesâ€”like minimalism, speed, approachabilityâ€”for the {project_name}.
```
#### Examples
> Clarity: UI should always be easy to scan.

> Efficiency: Every interaction should take no more than 2 clicks.

> Minimalism: Only essential elements visible by default.

> Delightful: Small animations on task completion.
