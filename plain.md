# PLAIN

## Initial Prompt fo AI

You are an expert UI/UX designer with strong experience in product discovery, information architecture, rapid prototyping, and frontend technologies. You are proficient in prompt-to-code and AI-assisted design tools such as v0, Bolt, Lovely, Uizard, and Figma Make.

Your task is to generate a complete PLAIN document for a given product idea.

- Begin by crafting a clear and concise **Idea Statement** that defines the core value, purpose, and problem the product addresses.
- Based on this idea, complete the rest of the PLAIN sections logically and consistently.
- Use your knowledge to make reasonable assumptions when information is missing.
- Write in a natural, human-readable tone suitable for both AI design tools and human product teams.
- Do not alter section titles or order. Fill in each one with clarity and purpose.

üéØ Your ultimate goal is to create a product definition that can be used as a blueprint for generating high-quality design systems, UI components, and frontend code ‚Äî both by AI tools and design teams.

## Idea Statement

Describe the core idea and value proposition of the product in 1‚Äì2 short paragraphs. Focus on the user problem it solves, the main features, and its target outcome. Avoid generic phrasing ‚Äî be specific about the product‚Äôs intent.

## Design Language

Define how the product should look, feel, and behave. Think of it as a visual and interaction manifesto. Fill in as many sub-sections as needed to reflect your vision.

  ### Design Principles
  Define guiding values for the interface ‚Äî e.g. clarity, speed, minimalism, playfulness.
  
  ### Color
  Specify primary color scheme, semantic colors, background colors. Mention light/dark mode if applicable.
  
  ### Design System
  Specify which system to follow (e.g. ‚ÄúUse Shadcn/UI‚Äù, ‚ÄúFollow Tailwind-inspired atomic tokens‚Äù), or create a custom one.

  ### Icons
  Define icon style (e.g. stroke, filled, 24px grid) and reference a library if needed (e.g. Lucide, Tabler).
  
  ### Typography
  Define font families, usage rules (e.g. headings vs body), line heights, font weights.
  
  ### Typescale
  Describe the vertical rhythm ‚Äî e.g. modular scale system, responsive variants, naming convention (xs, sm, base‚Ä¶).
  
  ### Layout
  Define container widths, grid structure, spacing scale, breakpoints.
  
  ### Core Components
  List essential components (buttons, inputs, cards, etc.) and their visual tone.
  
  ### Elevation System
  Define how layering and shadows are used for depth and interaction cues.
  
  ### Interaction Feedback

  ### Motion and Transition
  Outline key transitions, durations, easing curves. Define where motion should be used and where it shouldn‚Äôt.
  
  ### Visual Tone
  Define the emotional tone of visuals ‚Äî friendly, serious, playful, etc. (especially relevant for illustrations and imagery).
  
  ### Animation
  Specify rules or restrictions on animated elements. Are microinteractions allowed? Should transitions be subtle?
  
  ### Accessibility
  State key accessibility goals ‚Äî e.g. color contrast levels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support.
  
  ### Stylistic References
  Mention any visual benchmarks ‚Äî apps, websites, or dribbble shots that inspired the look.
