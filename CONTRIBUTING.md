# Contributing to PLAIN 🌱

Thanks for considering a contribution! PLAIN is an open source project and gets better with every improvement, whether it's fixing a typo, suggesting a new section, or sharing a real-world example.

This guide will help you get started.

## Ways to Contribute 📌

There are several ways to help PLAIN grow. Pick what suits you best.

- **Fix typos and improve clarity:** Spot a typo or awkward sentence? Submit a quick fix. Small improvements add up over time.
- **Improve the PLAIN template:** If you have ideas to make `PLAIN.md` clearer or more useful, suggest edits or submit a PR.
- **Share real-world examples:** If you've created a `{project-name}-plain.md` for your own project, submit it with a live demo or design link to inspire others.
- **Suggest structural changes:** If you think a section should be added, renamed, or removed, open an issue and let's discuss.

## How to Contribute 🧭

Contributing is simple. Fork the repo, create a branch, make your changes, and open a pull request.

1. **Fork the repository** and clone it locally.
2. **Create a branch** with a clear name like `fix/readme-typos` or `add/plain-taskly`.
3. **Make your changes** and follow existing formatting conventions.
4. **Open a pull request** with a short description of what you changed and why.

## Contribution Guidelines 📐

Keep these in mind when contributing:

- **Write clearly:** Make your content easy to understand for both humans and AI. Avoid vague or overly abstract language.
- **Stay consistent:** Follow the tone, format, and naming conventions used in existing files. For example submissions, use `{project-name}-plain.md` with lowercase letters and hyphens.
- **Use AI to polish your work:** This is an AI-focused project. Feel free to use Claude, ChatGPT, or other tools to refine your contributions.
- **Discuss big changes first:** For structural or conceptual changes, open an issue before submitting a PR.
