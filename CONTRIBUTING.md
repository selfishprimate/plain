# Contribution
_To contribute, or not to contribute, that is the question!_

Thanks for your interest in contributing to PLAIN (Product Language for AI Notation)!
This project aims to create a structured, markdown-based product definition format that helps bridge the gap between human teams and AI-powered tools.

Your feedback, ideas, and improvements are more than welcome.

## Where Can You Contribute? üìå

There are several meaningful ways to contribute to the PLAIN project ‚Äî whether you‚Äôre improving the core documentation, writing prompts, or offering few-shot examples for AI tools. Here‚Äôs how you can get involved:

- **Documentation:** You can help refine documents like plain.md, plain-explained.md, README.md, how-to-use.md, and others. Focus on clarity, accuracy, and usefulness ‚Äî especially for contributors who are using AI tools.
- **Demos:** Contribute to the /demos/ folder with complete product specifications using the PLAIN format. These files should follow the naming convention **plain-{project-name}.md** and adhere to the structure described in plain-explained.md. These serve as working examples for how to use the format in real-world scenarios.
- **Examples:** In the /examples/ folder, you can submit high-quality, section-level output examples that help AI understand what a good response looks like. These are helpful for training and referencing, and should map closely to the structure and tone described in the main documentation.
- **Prompts:** Contribute clear, varied, and effective prompt examples under the /prompts/ folder. These help guide users in generating PLAIN-compliant content using AI tools.
- **Structure Suggestions:** If you think a section should be added, renamed, merged, or removed, open an issue to start a discussion. We‚Äôre actively improving the format and welcome your ideas.

- **Use consistent naming:** Name all files in the format plain-{project-name}.md. Use lowercase letters and hyphens only. Avoid spaces, underscores, or capital letters.
- **Keep tone and formatting aligned:** Maintain the voice and format used across the existing documentation. This ensures cohesion, especially when documents are used as AI input.
- **Use AI to improve your writing:** This is an AI-focused project ‚Äî you‚Äôre most welcome to use AI tools (like ChatGPT or others) to revise, clarify, or polish your contributions before submitting them.
