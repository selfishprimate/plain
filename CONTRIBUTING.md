# Contribution
_To contribute, or not to contribute, that is the question!_

Thanks for your interest in contributing to PLAIN (Product Language for AI Notation)!
This project aims to create a structured, markdown-based product definition format that helps bridge the gap between human teams and AI-powered tools.

Your feedback, ideas, and improvements are more than welcome.

## Where Can You Contribute? üìå

There are several meaningful ways to contribute to the PLAIN project ‚Äî whether you‚Äôre improving the core documentation, adding real-world examples, or experimenting with AI tools. Here‚Äôs how you can get started:
- **Documentation:** _You can improve core markdown files._ You can edit and enhance the main project files like plain.md, plain-explained.md, or supporting documents such as how-to-use.md, why-markdown.md, and naming.md. Your improvements might include fixing typos, clarifying confusing language, or expanding short explanations to make them more helpful for new users and AI models alike.
- **Examples:** _Add real or fictional PLAIN documents._ Help expand the /examples/ folder by submitting complete PLAIN files using the naming format plain-{project-name}.md. Each example should follow the structure and tone described in plain-explained.md, offering helpful reference points for others using the format. 
- **Structure Suggestions:** _Improve the framework itself._ If you think a section is missing, redundant, or unclear, you can open a discussion to suggest changes to the structure. We‚Äôre open to merging, renaming, removing, or adding fields ‚Äî as long as it improves clarity and usability for both humans and AI.
- **Prompts:** _Share prompt ideas and phrasing patterns._ You can contribute to the /prompts/ folder by adding useful natural language commands for different sections. Well-written prompts help others get better results from AI tools and can be linked directly to example documents or use cases.
- **AI Tool Feedback:** _Share how you use PLAIN with tools._ If you‚Äôve used PLAIN with prompt-to-code or design-generation tools (like v0, Lovely, etc.), feel free to document your results, workflows, or tips. These contributions can be extremely helpful for teams just starting to experiment with AI-powered prototyping.

## Contribution Guidelines üìê

To keep the project high-quality and easy to navigate, please follow these guidelines when contributing:
- **Be clear and accessible:** Write in a way that is understandable to both human collaborators and AI systems. Avoid overly abstract or ambiguous phrasing.

- **Use consistent naming:** Name all files in the format plain-{project-name}.md. Use lowercase letters and hyphens only. Avoid spaces, underscores, or capital letters.
- **Keep tone and formatting aligned:** Maintain the voice and format used across the existing documentation. This ensures cohesion, especially when documents are used as AI input.
- **Use AI to improve your writing:** This is an AI-focused project ‚Äî you‚Äôre most welcome to use AI tools (like ChatGPT or others) to revise, clarify, or polish your contributions before submitting them.
- **Start discussions for major changes:** For structural or conceptual changes, please open an issue first to align with the maintainers and the community.
