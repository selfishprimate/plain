# Contributing to PLAIN

_To contribute, or not to contribute, that is the question!_

Thanks for your interest in contributing to **PLAIN (Product Language for AI Notation)**!

This project aims to create a structured, markdown-based product definition format that helps bridge the gap between human teams and AI-powered tools. Your feedback, ideas, and improvements are more than welcome.

## Where Can You Contribute? 📌

There are several meaningful ways to contribute to the PLAIN project — whether you're improving the core documentation, writing prompts, or offering few-shot examples for AI tools. Here's how you can get involved:

- **Documentation:** You can help refine documents like `plain.md`, `plain-explained.md`, `README.md`, and others. Focus on clarity, accuracy, and usefulness — especially for contributors who are using AI tools.

- **Demos:** Contribute to the `/demos/` folder with complete product specifications using the PLAIN format. These files should follow the naming convention **plain-{project-name}.md** and adhere to the structure described in `plain-explained.md`. These serve as working examples for how to use the format in real-world scenarios.

- **Examples:** In the `/examples/` folder, you can submit high-quality, section-level output examples that help AI understand what a good response looks like. These are helpful for training and referencing, and should map closely to the structure and tone described in the main documentation.

- **Prompts:** Contribute clear, varied, and effective prompt examples under the `/prompts/` folder. These help guide users in generating PLAIN-compliant content using AI tools.

- **Structure Suggestions:** If you think a section should be added, renamed, merged, or removed, open an issue to start a discussion. We're actively improving the format and welcome your ideas.

## How to Contribute 🧭

Contributing to PLAIN is simple and Git-friendly. Just follow these basic steps to get started:

1. **Fork the repository:** Click the Fork button at the top of this page to create your own copy of the repo.

2. **Create a new branch:** Before making changes, create a new branch with a clear name such as `fix/readme-typos` or `add/plain-taskly`.

3. **Make your changes:** Edit, add, or improve the relevant files in your local copy of the project. Follow existing formatting and naming conventions where possible.

4. **Review your changes:** Double-check for typos, structure consistency, and accurate section placement. Make sure your content is easy to read for both humans and AI.

5. **Open a pull request:** Submit your changes by opening a pull request (PR). Describe what you changed and why — this helps maintainers review it efficiently.

## Contribution Guidelines 📐

To keep the project high-quality and easy to navigate, please follow these guidelines when contributing:

- **Be clear and accessible:** Write in a way that is understandable to both human collaborators and AI systems. Avoid overly abstract or ambiguous phrasing.

- **Follow the structure:** Use `plain-explained.md` as your reference. Each section has a purpose — respect its role and write with intention.

- **Use consistent naming:** Name all files in the format `plain-{project-name}.md`. Use lowercase letters and hyphens only. Avoid spaces, underscores, or capital letters.

- **Keep tone and formatting aligned:** Maintain the voice and format used across the existing documentation. This ensures cohesion, especially when documents are used as AI input.

- **Use AI to improve your writing:** This is an AI-focused project — you're most welcome to use AI tools (like ChatGPT, Claude, or others) to revise, clarify, or polish your contributions before submitting them.

- **Start discussions for major changes:** For structural or conceptual changes, please open an issue first to align with the maintainers and the community.

## File Naming Conventions 📝

When contributing demo files or examples, please follow these naming conventions:

- Demo files: `plain-{project-name}.md` (e.g., `plain-taskly.md`)
- Example files: `example-{section-name}.md` (e.g., `example-design-language.md`)
- Prompt files: `prompt-{use-case}.md` (e.g., `prompt-generate-full-spec.md`)

Use lowercase letters and hyphens only. No spaces, underscores, or capital letters.
